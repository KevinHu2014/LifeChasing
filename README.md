## LifeChasing
A Location-based Game Prototype for Elderly Health Promotion

## Background
This research is aimed at developing an age-friendly location-based game prototype â€“ Life Chasing, the goal is promoting the health of the elderly. The interface design of the game follows the Universal Design and the design-for-elderly guidelines. Besides various incentive mechanisms within the game play, an experience evaluation module is developed in Life Chasing. Based on the principle of experience design, the game will collect all game- related data, including environmental data; physical information of player, etc. The evaluation module returns the analytical results (including the heartbeat analysis from the integrated wristband) to the player, who can setup the game that best meets the individual's personal needs.
